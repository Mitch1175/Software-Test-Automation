# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
In order to make sure that everything is functional and secure, there needs to be tests run that can pinpoint any potential error or threat. In this course, I learned how to use JUnit testing and the importance of making sure the tests also cover all of the requirements.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User's needs are incorporated by listing requirements. Each requirement is broken down and tested multiple times to ensure that it works correctly. In a real world situation, the client will sit with the programmer and tell them everything that they want in their program. The programmer will note each requirement and incorporate it to the best of their ability.

# How do I approach designing software?
Designing the software is the easy part. Getting it all right is the hard part. Many times throughout the coding process there will be errors and bugs that need to be fixed. By testing small increments of code at a time, the programmer can ensure that what has already been coded works as it is intended to.
